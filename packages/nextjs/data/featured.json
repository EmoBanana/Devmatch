    "description": "The aim of this study was to investigate whether Chaga mushroom extract affects the growth and metabolism of oral cancer cells. Alterations in cellular metabolism—including glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration—by treatment with Chaga mushroom extract are involved in oral cancer cell behavior, such as autophagy, cell cycle, and apoptosis.",
